    <h2 class="sub-title">What is the thesis of this article?</h2>

    <p>
        The thesis of this article is a series of ideas that revolves around the concept of "handmade web" by Carpenter. 
        The author introduces the term "handmade" and refers to "handmade web" the websites that are fully coded by hand but not software. 
        They are not used by businesses or large-scale companies but by individuals who made them. 
        In other words, it is more unique, temporary and challenges more factors that other web pages would not have. 
        Carpenter uses the word "handmade web" to make the correlation between other handmade mediums, 
        but also to distinguish and highlight the essence of the handmade web. He also talks about his intention to 
        promote the "ongoing active engagement" of the creation of web pages and web policies, mentioning the personal web 
        identity that was visioned earlier. Carpenter also mentions the persistence of Web 1.0 aesthetics on the Internet, 
        implying the remembrance of the early Web. Ultimately, the term "handmade web" is essentially used to promote slowness and 
        embrace small-scale resistance against the increasingly sophisticated nature of the web.

    <h2 class="sub-title">In your own words, what is being resisted?</h2>
    <p>
        Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. 
        In my own words, the dominance of "multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, 
        Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers" is being resisted. Carpenter suggested that by choosing to hand-code 
        and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects, creators resist the proprietary and standardized nature of the web, advocating 
        for a more personalized, individualized, and decentralized approach to web development and content creation. The fact of being unique and 
        personalized, the handmade web would be the main factor in resisting the current structures of the web pages, allowing more individual 
        creative freedom and pushing the norms of current structural corporate entities.

    <h3 class="sub-title">Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the “physicality” of the web?</h3>
    <p class="last">
        Growing up with the existence of technology, my encounters with the “physicality” of the web involve multiple experiences that 
        emphasize the influence and impact of web applications. Some examples can be listed as my interaction with devices and hardware, 
        haptic feedback that provides digital interactions, 3D printing, AR/VR, accessibility devices and various user interfaces. 
        While most of our interactions with the web are considered virtual and digital, there are still some web experiences that 
        offer the physical nature of them - being able to personalize, focus on the individual habitat, interact and modify the tangible experiences. 
        The physicality of the web also opens up opportunities for multisensory engagement, enhancing user experiences and interactions with the web. 
        For creators in general, this also allows more room for creative expression as they can explore various approaches towards digital content, 
        integrating physical materials to evoke tangible experiences. This adaptation to the changing technologies is a result of the constantly evolving web, 
        especially when it includes customization options that can influence digital outcomes, enrich online experience but remain the nature of the web.
