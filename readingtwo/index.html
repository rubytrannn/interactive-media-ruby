    <h1 class="title">Reading Respond Two</h1>

    <h2 class="sub-title">What is the thesis of this article?</h2>

    <p>
        The thesis of this article started with Chimero’s delve into his exploration to find similarities between 
        the growth of designing for screens and the development of aspirin as well as the evolution of technology and software. 
        He focuses on the changes in physicality and potency in both of them. As pharmaceutical companies have made the active drug 
        in aspirin more effective and physically smaller, the design of computers has also evolved to revolve around screens primarily. 
        Chimero introduces the term “flux” as it is the capacity for change. The article emphasizes the importance of designing interfaces 
        that effectively manage change, utilizing animation and responsive design principles to clarify interactions and convey information 
        to adapt to users’ experiences, one of many ways is to treat the window as a physical object. Moreover, Chimero also raises the 
        conversation of two different screen design ideologies: flat and skeuomorphs. However, he argues that “screens are aesthetically neutral”, 
        and that both approaches cannot answer the deeper question of designing for screens since they are based on aesthetics. Instead, Chimero 
        suggests that it should focus on understanding screens as a special material for the shape of interaction and interface design. 
        In conclusion, the article is a suggestion to rethink screen design aside from the aesthetics but the quality of screens to effectively 
        manage change and enhance user experience.

    <h2 class="sub-title">Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?</h2>
    <p>
        I would prefer flat design in my early design practices since I want to focus on essential content and reduce visual clutter before jumping into different aspects of design. 
        Since flat design is about simplicity and minimalism, it focuses more on functionality and usability, which I am prioritizing my design, 
        especially in the world of digital product design. Moreover, a flat design also allows for a clean and crisp interface design, which would simplify 
        the user experience and highlight the key components, making it easier to direct attention in the complex world of overwhelming digital products. 
        On the other hand, while skeuomorphic design mimics real-world objects and textures, I think it would be better to implement it in a more immersive environment 
        to leverage users’ ideas of how physical objects function, where users expect tangible interactions. By applying a skeuomorphic design, it would enhance the 
        realism of user experience in the digital world. However, it should be fully in digital mode, in order not to distract the design objectives. 
        Ultimately, the design decisions should also be considered based on usability testing and user feedback to establish the effectiveness of a design approach.

        What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? 
        Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
        </h3>
    <p class="last">
        A zoopraxiscope is an early device used for displaying motion pictures. It was invented by Eadweard Muybridge in the late 19th century 
        and was one of the earliest tools for creating animations. The zoopraxiscope consisted of a rotating glass disc with sequential images 
        painted or printed on it. When the disc was spun rapidly, the images appeared to animate, creating the illusion of motion. In the context of 
        web and interaction design, the zoopraxiscope serves as a historical precursor to modern animation techniques used in digital interfaces. 
        It is the foundation of using animation as a storytelling and communication tool, highlighting the importance of motion in modern human-computer 
        interaction as well as the usability of digital interfaces. Nowadays, animations can be used to enhance user experience by providing feedback and guiding them through interfaces. 
        By understanding the principles of motion and animation, designers can create effective communication platforms for more engaging and intuitive interfaces.  
        <br><br>
        Another example from filmmaking that has inspired digital design is “storyboarding”. It is a series of rough sketches that illustrate key moments, 
        camera angles and transitions, which has influenced digital design by providing a structured approach to visualizing and organizing user experience. 
        For instance, a UI/UX designer often has to create wireframes and mockups that serve a similar purpose as storyboards in filmmaking. These concepts are all similar and serve as valuable 
        frameworks for designers/creators to refine their designs after multiple processes of conceptualizing and planning, which would lead to effective digital experiences.
