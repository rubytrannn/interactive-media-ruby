    <h1>Welcome to Toronto</h1>

    <h2>Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, 
        is a major Canadian city along the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.</h2>

    <section class="container"> The name "Toronto" is derived from the Mohawk word "tkaronto," which means "where there are trees standing in the water." 
        This originally referred to a fishing weir in Lake Simcoe. </section>

    <h3>Toronto is Canada's most populous city, 
        with a population of over 2.7 million people within the city proper and over 6 million 
        in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). </h3>

    <h4>Toronto is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with over half of its population born outside of Canada. 
        This diversity is reflected in its neighborhoods, cuisine, festivals, and cultural institutions. </h4>
